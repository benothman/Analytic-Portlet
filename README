Welcome on GateIn Analytic Portal

This project tends to provide an analytic portal based on Google Analytics,
and is a maven project. This project was built using Java 6 but compatible
Java 5. To install, deploy and run the project please follow steps below :


1) If you don't have maven installed yet, so start with downloading and install
   it, you find all steps for that in the link below, to ensure that it was 
   correctly installed, open a terminal window and type the following command :
   
   ~home$ mvn --version
   
   and you should have something like this (run on Mac OSX) :
   
      Apache Maven 2.2.0 (r788681; 2009-06-26 15:04:01+0200)
      Java version: 1.6.0_20
      Java home: /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6.0/Home
      Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: MacRoman
      OS name: "mac os x" version: "10.6.4" arch: "x86_64" Family: "mac"
   
   
   
   NB : if you are using Windows OS, please refer to Maven website for more
        details about how to install and configure Maven.
   
   Download link : http://maven.apache.org/

2) Once installed and configured, open a terminal window and go to the project
   install directory. Type the command below :
   
   	~projectHome$ mvn clean install
   
   this should take a while until maven resolve all dependencies and downloads
   needed libraries, note that this is only for the first build because maven
   install libs locally.

3) Once built, you should have a war file under directory "target" that you
   can deploy on your GateIn portal server.
   
4) To register the portlet, please refer to GateIn tutorial. Note that it is
   recommended to add the portlet to application layout and not to a specific
   page, otherwise only that page will be tracked.
   
5) After registering and adding the portlet, you should have a valid Google
   Analytics account where you can register you domain to get a Track ID that
   you will use for tracking your application.
   
6) Once you have all the ingredients, logon as administrator and open the portlet
   in edit mode, enter your track ID, select your options and click on save button.
   
7) Now it is ready to work !
