    <p>
        Google Analytics Portlet is a useful portlet which allows you to track user and groups for your portal.
        Users can be authenticated or not, simple users or administrators etc.
        This portlet allows you also to track used languages according to user preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since this portlet is based on Google Analytics and for tracking it uses a heavy weight script so
        it is highly recommended to put the portlet in the footer of your page layout to guarantee that all pages will
        be tracked and the page loading is not blocking.
